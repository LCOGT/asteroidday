Aw, I wanted to be ginger! I've never been ginger! And you, Rose Tyler! Fat lot of good you were! You gave up on me! Ooh, that's rude. Is that the sort of man I am now? Am I rude? Rude and not ginger. Don't you think she looks tired? There's something else I've always wanted to say: Allons-y, Alonso!\r\n\r\nNew-new-Doctor. I'll tell you what, then: don't...step on any butterflies. What have butterflies ever done to you? Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear! There's only one reason I would ever tell anyone my name. There's only one time I could... You need to get yourself a better dictionary. When you do, look up 'genocide'. You'll find a little picture of me there, and the caption'll read 'Over my dead body'. I'd call you a genius, except I'm in the room.\r\n\r\nI'm the Doctor, I can save the world with a kettle and some string! And look! I'm wearing a vegetable! Goodbye...my Sarah Jane! I don't want to go. What? What?! WHAT?! Blimey, trying to make an Ood laugh... Oh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: it is very good at opening doors! New-new-Doctor. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. River, you know my name. You whispered my name in my ear!
